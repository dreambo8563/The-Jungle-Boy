# The-Jungle-Boy

## Learning Project with PIXI.js

I download all the free assets from https://itch.io | https://www.gameart2d.com

create sprite jsonfile with the tool https://asyed94.github.io/sprite-sheet-to-json

#### Learning Points:

- load sound
- load Assets and cache before using
- AnimatedSprite with json file
- keyboard events handler
- using k-v map to avoid repeated consume events
- using anchor to correct position
- scale sprite to fit the game
- zIndex and sortableChildren to sort order

#### TODO

- climb the tree
- we need a boss
- add powerful skill
- loading progress and start screen

#### How to Play

- How to get the game
  - visit the github pages
  - clone the repo and start local server (like `python3 -m http.server 8080 ` )
- Operation
  - a/s/d/f to attach
  - arrows to move
